# This is github repo for the NPTEL course on Data structures, Algorithms and Programming Using Python.

* This a 12 weeks long course, and I am going to maintain this repo for my measuring my development.
Hope this will be fun.

* Update: 24/01/2021
The videos of first week are out and I did the assignment. This time the assignment was a quiz so I can't put it here, but they were based on gcd algorithm whose code is in here.
The due date is 02/02/2021.
